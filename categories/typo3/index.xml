      <description>A nice thing to have at hand is definately Signal and Slots. I heard Felix talking about them quite often and I finally found a nice usecase and came to play with them a little bit this afternoon. And just to avoid that others have to look around too much to find how they can get them to work here&amp;rsquo;s how it&amp;rsquo;s working for me.
First of all you should understand the concept.</description>

The changelog shows that they mainly changed some security issues and that a lot of smaller changes in the backend happend - one change relates to the problems in the new Firefox 3 where all the frames in the backend are mixed up for some compatibility reason&amp;hellip; this was also the reason why the also updates the 4.</description>

      <description>The last weekend was great, I joined the T3DD in Elmshorn, Germany and meet a lot of interesting people, the beer was cheap and the weather was amazing. So I&amp;rsquo;m looking forward to the T3CON in autumn&amp;hellip; :)
It also seems that some of the guys got some new spirit - today 4 official and some inofficial bugs in some extensions had been fixed in a very short sequence &amp;hellip; great!</description>
