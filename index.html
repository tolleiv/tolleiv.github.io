      <div class="content">
        If you’re running your own monitoring system which has to observe services for global customers, you might have considered to spin up some monitoring slaves around the world to gather accurate availability data. Unfortunately bringing up these slaves is time consuming and expensive to some extend. On the other hand services like Pingdom provide global monitoring for low budget. But using these splits your monitoring infrastructure into two parts and brings drawbacks when it comes to reporting and alerting.

      <div class="content">
        Few months ago I tried to get my head around Post-Mortem documentations and found it particularly hard to fill the gap between the publicly available documentations and my aim to have company internal documentations which teams could use to share knowledge and learn from past mistakes. During my research I came across lot’s of publicly available information which helped me to dive into the topic. But unfortunately information was widely distributed and I though that sharing my link collection could help to shorten your way a bit.

        In my previous post I&rsquo;ve pointed out some tools which make your live with Chef much easier. Among these, Berkshelf helps with managing cookbooks and their dependencies. Depending on your workflows these can be very straight forward or grow very complex.
I had some free time and thought that visualizing these dependencies as graphs could be a fun weekend project. You can test out the results on berksgraph.

        In the past years I&rsquo;ve jumped into the role of the DevOps evangelist at AOE. As it seems this was quite successful and people joined in quickly. But due to the fact that DevOps for us also means that less trained colleges should participate in most parts of the codified infrastructure, it requires some quality assurance efforts in the background. An overview of the tools which help us to keep things clean, is what I wanted to share in this post.

      <div class="content">
        The following is going to show some pitfalls and their solution when working with NodeJs, Socket.IO and concurrent processes.
Basic setup Socket connections In order to use socket communication with NodeJS a basic server side code block might look this see online docs:
var io = require('socket.io').listen(80); io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.emit('news', { hello: 'world' }); });  This enables you to send some data through the socket connection to the client and with just a little more code it could even retrieve some data from the client.

        I&rsquo;ve finally managed to step away from Wordpress and migrated my blog to Octopress. There were many reasons for me, the main reason was that I didn&rsquo;t want to host it by myself anymore.
The migration itself was guided by some blog posts which helped me a lot to get insights into Octopress:
 Migrating 40,000 Posts From Wordpress to Octopress Octopress SEO and Disabling the Blog Route Custom Domain With Octopress and Github Pages Create Custom Rss Feed for Octopress Add Flattr to Octopress  Besides that I managed to keep all the old URLs and migrated the comments to Diqus which went pretty smooth with very little configuration.

        It seems that publishing the news regarding TemplaVoila came to the right time and it found its way through the community. But along with it, some irritation came up which needs some additional words.
Will there be a TYPO3 CMS 6.2 compatible version of TemplaVoila? **As it seems: yes - **some members of the community offered their help. I&rsquo;ll reach out to them in the next days and try to connect them as good as I can.

        If you followed some of my comments in the TYPO3 newsgroups recently, you&rsquo;ve heard that I&rsquo;m not very satisfied with the TYPO3 project in general and that&rsquo;s also reflected in my activity for TemplaVoila. After a certain time of inactivity I even had to ask myself whether it&rsquo;s wort to keep it in the TYPO3 universe or not. Due to the fact that this isn&rsquo;t an easy decision, I created a pro and con list which I&rsquo;d like to share, before I make conclusions.

        Configuration interface.One thing I took along from last year&rsquo;s ApacheCon was the idea to combine Apache Solr along with some mathematical search algorithms to figure out boost factor values. I did some work on that back then and on the way to this year&rsquo;s BerlinBuzzwords. Now I finally have a proof-of-concept working which I&rsquo;d like to share. If you want to have a look right away - the code can be found on Github.

What happend? In his post Robert kind of gave up his attempts to establish a TYPO3 product board [1]. The reasons for this are very wide-spread and mainly the various flame-wars in the last year and the very personal attacts brought him to the conclusion to:
