      <description>TYPO3 4.4 ships with a long list of improvements. One of them is the sprite API which was developed during T3UXW09. It extends the iconWorks API and enables to retrieve any backend-icon from a central sprite.
As extension maintainer there are several ways to use these new parts of the API you can either just use it to display core icons, you can include your own icons and retrieve it with the new API or you can include your own sprite and retrieve the separate icons.</description>

      <title>Crawler 3.1 release &#43; podcast</title>

      <description>Nearly a month after version 3.0.5, we published 3.1.0 of the well known crawler extension today. The main work for that step was related to several bugfixes, a better scheduler integration, some CLI-API enhancements, better testcases and (finally) some documentation updates. Most kudos go to Michael Klapper who took over the responsibility for this release and who also fixed a decent amount of bugs. You can download the extension in the TER  and hopefully this time OpenOffice didn&amp;rsquo;t trick us again and you&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see a shiny new extension manual on typo3.</description>

      <title>Handling data in TYPO3 with tcemain</title>

      <description>TYPO3 is (by definition) a powerful tool when it comes to data. Besides creating, updating and deleting data there are also localizing and versioning, logging and even rollbacks. All this is provided through the GUI of TYPO3 and all the technical stuff in working under the hood of TYPO3 for nearly every piece of data. But what if you&amp;rsquo;re asked to write a script which imports or updates data, how can you make sure that all this is done in a TYPO3 compatible way?</description>

      <description>Last Sunday I&amp;rsquo;ve released the first official stable version of my imagemap_wizard extension (TER). I though that&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to review the introduction text on the project-homepage and that&amp;rsquo;s how it looks like - forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-imagemap_wizard
Especially due to the missing/broken TER download counter I&amp;rsquo;m still not sure whether the work was worth it. I hope some marketing and the given information about all the cool featutes is enough for newbees and TYPO3 pro&amp;rsquo;s.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently within the preparation for some exams therefore my day&amp;rsquo;s aren&amp;rsquo;t very fancy at all - and that&amp;rsquo;s why I just decided to introduce some TYPO3 extensions - especially TYPO3 extensions where I&amp;rsquo;m somehow involved ;)
The mentioned extensions are all created by AOEmedia or in cooperation with AOEmedia, they&amp;rsquo;re actively maintained and they work within regular TYPO3 environments with all TYPO3 features -lot&amp;rsquo;s of other extensions don&amp;rsquo;t support l10n and workspaces - ours do ;) Please use the mentioned pages on forge.</description>
