      <description>Quite some things changed in the past months and I never found the time to clear up my mind and write up a summary.
First of all TemplaVoila 1.6 was released parallel to TYPO3 4.6. It shipped with 22 bug and compatibility fixes. In general the 1.6.x branch is supposed to be compatible with TYPO3 4.4+ which also made it possible to clean up the extension quite a bit. In addition to that TemplaVoila 1.</description>

      <description>I just push the TER upload button two times and in addition to that TYPO3 4.5.2 will be released tomorrow containing some nice workspaces updates. So here&amp;rsquo;s a short summary what happened in the extension releases.
TemplaVoila 1.5.4 The current release focussed on 4.5 compatibility. It uses the new sys_language flag &amp;ldquo;format&amp;rdquo; to support sprites, it hooks into the new backend-form (TCA) &amp;ldquo;layout&amp;rdquo; and add&amp;rsquo;s it&amp;rsquo;s fields to the right tabs within the backend forms and adjusts everything to work fine with the new CSRF mechanism.</description>

      <description>The new version comes with many bugfixes,new features and a closer TYPO3 integration. Overall 95 issues have been resolved in the last 4 months to finalize this versions, some of the highlights are:
HTML5 support The full list of HTML5 tags is now supported in TemplaVoila. The restrictions to specific tags was removed and the TYPO3 integrator is now able to use the full bandwidth of modern HTML. With this change also the tag-icons themself were replaced and the coloring schema was changed.</description>

      <description>Update: Finally TemplaVoila moved to git.typo3.org - please read the update here
 As it seems, souce code version control for TYPO3 will be done with Git in the future. The Phoenix team already uses git.typo3.org, there&amp;rsquo;s also already the possibility to get the latest updates for the v4 Core via github.com and it won&amp;rsquo;t take long until git.typo3.org is been used for version 4 as well.
Due to the fact that my TemplaVoila development workflow is also already git based, I thought it might be interesting for some contributors to develop with a git repository upstream.</description>

      <description>Yesterday the 2nd team release of TemplaVoila was uploaded into the TER. It&amp;rsquo;s basically a maintenance release which fixes more than 100 bugs. But since we haven&amp;rsquo;t been that straight distinguishing between bug and usability feature, you&amp;rsquo;ll see a couple of new things within this release.
The high level release notes are:
 page module is now customizable with CSS and JavaScript
 handling of static data structures are improved and fully working now</description>

      <description>Dmitry decided to leave the TemplaVoilà project today and he handed the extension-leadership to me. Since this is a very abrupt change and since there was lot&amp;rsquo;s of (mis)communication involved I&amp;rsquo;d like to use this blogpost to answer his &amp;ldquo;Farewell, TemplaVoila!&amp;rdquo; post (he turned off the commenting function).
As you might know Steffen Kamper and I joined the TemplaVoilà team some time ago and since Dmitry wasn&amp;rsquo;t very motivated to maintain the extension anymore, we took over and tried to make TemplaVoilà ready for TYPO3 4.</description>

      <description>A new version of TemplaVoila (ter) (forge) has just been released. Besides the great fact that this is the first team-release of TemplaVoila, the high-level improvements within the pagemodule (drag&amp;rsquo;n&amp;rsquo;drop), the mapping module and the FCE editing forms and besides lot&amp;rsquo;s of bug fixes, there are a few very nice features which make the day-to-day work with TemplaVoila much easier.
The list of things which happend in 1.4 can be seen on bugs.</description>

      <title>disable TemplaVoila new page wizard</title>
      <link>//blog.tolleiv.de/2009/06/disable-templavoila-new-page-wizard/</link>

      <description>TemplaVoila&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;new page wizard&amp;rdquo; is a pretty cool featue - at least if your page templates have a thumbnail and a description. If your &amp;ldquo;new page wizard&amp;rdquo; look like the image on the right you might consider to turn it of.
That&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy just paste this into the Page TSConfig of your rootpage and you&amp;rsquo;re done: mod.web_list.newPageWiz.overrideWithExtension &amp;gt; Now you might wonder how TemplaVoila knows what template it should use to render the page - but due to the TV&amp;rsquo;s default behaviour to inherit the page-template this should not be a problem if there&amp;rsquo;s at least a TemplaVoila page template assigned for your root-page.</description>

      <description>Dmitry and Steffen included some of the AOE guys (including me) into the TemplaVoila team and we all try to contribute into the project from now on. Therefore I just checked the Unit-tests for TemplaVoila and tried to find a way how to improve them in the future and somewhere within the tx_templavoila_api -Class I found the PageTS key &amp;ldquo;tx_templavoila.storagePid&amp;rdquo;. That seems to be some kind of nice workaround for everyone who&amp;rsquo;s not interested to mess up the TYPO3 general record storage page with the TemplaVoila DS/TO storage-folder.</description>
