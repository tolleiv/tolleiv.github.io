#### About this blog

Every now and then I've to share some insights into parts of my work as it nerd // programmer and sometime I'm just sharing things I found interesting or which I wanted to point others to.


#### About me

I'm a (year()-1981) year old OpenSource enthusiast. I used and developed things for TYPO3 since 2004 and started to work with Puppet and Chef in 2011. Since 9 years I'm part of the [AOE](http://aoe.com) team as a Senior developer and DevOps evangelist. Besides that I've studied Computer Science at the great [Technical University of Chemnitz](http://www.tu-chemnitz.de).

Get in touch we me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/tolleiv), [LinkedIn](http://de.linkedin.com/pub/tolleiv-nietsch/25/a0a/857/en), [Xing](https://www.xing.com/profile/Tolleiv_Nietsch) or [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/people/@/528343772).


#### About my TYPO3 involvement


Besides client-specific work, I used to maintain several popular TYPO3 extensions ([templavoila](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/), [languagevisibility](http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-languagevisibility), [l10nmgr](http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-l10nmgr), [crawler ](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/crawler/current/) [and others](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/?tx_terfe_pi1[view]=search&no_cache=1&tx_terfe_pi1[sword]=tolleiv) ). In addition I'm was part of the workspace-team, the TYPO3 Core team and took care of typo3.org. By now I've stopped my public involvement with TYPO3 as it was to challenging for me to contribute in a peacful and productive way.

Oh and most important - receiving things from my [Amazon wishlist](http://www.amazon.de/registry/wishlist/K48CS8V4DZ4I/ref=cm_wl_rlist_go) makes me very happen ;)

> But you know, I've learned something today: You see, the basis of all reasoning is the mind's awareness of itself. What we think, the external objects we perceive, are all like actors that come on and off stage. But our consciousness, the stage itself, is always present to us. _Kyle Broslovski_
