There's so much work in this week that I can't publish a article in the next days.  
But Natalie Jost from [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/) just published a very nice article which you really should read if you're (like me) working from home [read on..](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/walkingthelinewhenyouworkfromhome) ... you'll like it.
