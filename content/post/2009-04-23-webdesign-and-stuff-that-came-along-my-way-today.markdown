A friend of mine recommended this URL in regards to one topic which I'm currently working on: [Designing Drop-Down Menus: Examples and Best Practices ](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/03/24/designing-drop-down-menus-examples-and-best-practices/). This article about how to use Drop-Down menus within the navigation, including some DOs and some DONTs,Â  is a very nice summary for anyone who creates designs with these elements.

After I scanned that article, I found another one which will be my default answer in the future whenever clients or coworkers ask strange questions about features and designs: [9 Common Usability Mistakes In Web Design | How-To | Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2009/02/18/9-common-usability-blunders/). There are lot's of lists around in the Web but there aren't so many sources with this quality and with such an amount of good quality comments in it.

I also discovered a new TYPO3 extension which will be imho very popular in the future - check it out yourself - [canonical extension in TER](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/canonical/). Regarding the TER I also found this [link](http://community.zikula.org/module-Extensions-display-ot-component-componentid-37.htm) some days ago within the newsgroups and I like to idea of having this for TYPO3 -I wonder whether this will stay a dream :P

And finally I just caught up with my RSS reader and the last article was the most interesting for today, since it is written from a different perspective (type-designer perspective) and it's really interesting how he images the future for fonts in the web.
