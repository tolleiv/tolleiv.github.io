It seems that publishing the [news regarding TemplaVoila](http://blog.tolleiv.de/2013/06/templavoila-future/) came to the right time and it found its way through the community. But along with it, some irritation came up which needs some additional words.


### Will there be a TYPO3 CMS 6.2 compatible version of TemplaVoila?


**As it seems: yes - **some members of the community offered their help. I'll reach out to them in the next days and try to connect them as good as I can. I will of course support them as good as possible. I can't really tell whether there will be a TER release for that or whether we'll keep it in the Git repository only. That's up for discussion - I made my point about that already and find it still valid. In case you're interested to help (coding, documentation, anything) - just sent me a note.


### Was it a black day for the community?


**I doubt that - **a [single tweet](http://twitter.com/spacedani/status/343756724198576130) mentioning people clapping on the news made a [large wave](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-german/2013-June/093272.html) through the newsgroups, nothing else. Most likely this was just a misunderstanding and most importantly it didn't reflect the generally very positive feedback I got through all other canals.


### What about #T3CS13?


That's first of all a great community event and everyone should reach out for #T3CS14 tickets next year. Nevertheless as it seems [some people (still) clapped their hands](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-english/2013-June/086209.html) when they heard the TemplaVoila news,[ which seemed very inappropriate](http://twitter.com/StGebert/status/343675163814006784). Due to that Jochen Weiland (one of the organizers) sent a personal apology to me and an "[official tweet](http://twitter.com/t3cs/status/344432618688892928)" for what happened at the #T3CS13. From my perspective this wasn't even needed, but it's nice that he did it anyways. The fact that [Peter Pröll](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-english/2013-June/086209.html) [(proof)](http://twitter.com/robert_we/status/343751092254949376) made a very clear statement during the event about some peoples misbehavior was already the right move. So let's just close this chapter.


### What are the alternatives, now?


We'll see, but I hope that 6.2 or 6.3 will come along with a very strong suggestion in that regard and maybe a "Core candidate" extension/solution. Just to avoid that a double or triple-solution situation starts to grow once again.



Finally thanks for all the warm words and wishes. This made me very happy. Also please keep in mind that I just maintained TemplaVoila during the last 3-4 years and that I took over from Dmitry, Robert and Kasper.
