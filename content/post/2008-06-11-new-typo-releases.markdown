I just saw that the TYPO3 guys released a new version of the popular Enterprise CMS ([www.typo3.org](http://www.typo3.org)). The changelog shows that they mainly changed some security issues and that a lot of  smaller changes in the backend happend - one change relates to the problems in the new Firefox 3 where all the frames in the backend are mixed up for some compatibility reason... this was also the reason why the also updates the 4.0.x branch and the 4.1.x branch ...
