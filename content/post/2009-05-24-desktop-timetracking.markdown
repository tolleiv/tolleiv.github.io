I just saw that Heiner already published a new (stable) version of his Desktop-Timetracking software.  Within this version he did a lot of refactoring - actually I helped out with some work and with lot's of smart³ comments ;) - and I'm really proud that I got him into [TDD](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). Check out [DPDesktop at sourceforge.net](http://dpdesktop.sourceforge.net/wordpress/)
