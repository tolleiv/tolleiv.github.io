Seems that this year I might have the chance to travel a lot and I also planned to go to London. I hope that besides my business-trips I find some time to go to london this summer. I hope that video keeps my motivation a but higher: [vimeo]http://vimeo.com/2169237[/vimeo]

Btw.Â  I learned to play [Daft Punk](http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daft_Punk)'s "Around the world on a guitar 11 years ago. It is actually the only thing I every learned on a guitar --- maybe someone could borrow me a guitar for some days so that I can pratice again :D
