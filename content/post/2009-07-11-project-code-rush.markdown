A pretty interesting documentation about the phase of the open source release of Mozilla in 1999.
They just published this documentation (which aired 2000) because there's no Copyright for it. I find it interesting because you can see why Open Source can succeed and you can also see why the Internet-Bubble was growing. It's interesting how these developers live and how they work. It's scary that some of them found it normal to stay in their office for the entire week just to get rid of some bugs. ;)

It also contains some interesting quotes - my favorite is: "Managing developers is like trying to herd cat's" ...
