Wow check this out - [Spreeblick](http://www.spreeblick.com) one of Germanys most popular blogs had some kind of protest agains the governmentsÂ  internet filter some days ago. They asked their users to click on a germany-map and leave a comment to "vote" against the filter.

Afterwards they published the XML-Data of this and [Micheal Schieben](http://vimeo.com/rockitbaby) published this very impressive [visualization of the internet-protest ](http://www.spreeblick.com/2009/04/24/von-laien-regiert-%e2%80%93-von-schieben-visualisiert/). It was produced with [processing](http://www.processing.org/) (one of my early loves) and he also published the [source-code](http://www.twoantennas.com/projects/protest-gegen-internetsperren/protest_gegen_internetsperren.pde) ... great work :)
