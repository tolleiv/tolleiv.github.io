It seems that the newsgroup is a nice tool for the discussion but not to keep track of the actual changes -To get an idea of what actually happend at the code-base usually you might want to look at the ChangeLog. Therefore I had a script which converted the ChangeLog to an atom feed - a couple of colleagues liked this idea and asked me to publish it - so here it is: [http://feeds.feedburner.com/TYPO3-CoreTrunkChangelog](http://feeds.feedburner.com/TYPO3-CoreTrunkChangelog)

_Update: - seems that I had small problems generating proper real [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier)s, this is hopefully fixed now...._
