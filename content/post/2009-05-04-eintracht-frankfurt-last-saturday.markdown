I just found this on YouTube ... I was in the stadium and that was the saddest moment on Saturday - spending 34â‚¬ to see such a lousy game with two stupid goals for the opponents.

I can't really imagine how they got their 32 points during the season and I don't really like the way the played soccer over the last few years - during the second half they didn't even really shout into the direction of Dortmunds goal :( - currently I think that it can't get worse.
