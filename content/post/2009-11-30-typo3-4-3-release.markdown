Today the TYPO3 Core Team released version 4.3 ([release-notes on typo3.org](https://typo3.org/download/release-notes/typo3-43/)).

Finally the list of improvements is long and the amount of cool new features is outstanding compared to other releases. Imho especially the security and performance-improvements are remarkable as well as the improved usability in the backend. But I guess my favorite improvement is obvious ([hint hint](https://typo3.org/download/release-notes/typo3-43/#c5642)) :P

In addition to TYPO3 4.3 a new major version of the tt_news ([ter](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/tt_news/current/)) extension was released over the weekend ([Rupert Germans announcement on lists.typo3.org](http://lists.typo3.org/pipermail/typo3-dev/2009-November/037916.html)) and the already mentioned [release of TemplaVoil√†](http://blog.tolleiv.de/2009/11/templavoila-1-4-released/) ([ter](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/templavoila/current/)) was somehow releated as well.

The next TYPO3 release is planned for May 2010... we'll see if that happens in time ;)
