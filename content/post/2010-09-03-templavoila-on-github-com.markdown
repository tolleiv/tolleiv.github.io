Update: Finally TemplaVoila moved to git.typo3.org  - please read the [update here](http://blog.tolleiv.de/2012/01/templavoila-1-6-x/)




As it seems, souce code version control for TYPO3 will be done with Git in the future. The Phoenix team already uses git.typo3.org, there's also already the possibility to get the latest updates for the v4 Core via [github.com](http://github.com/typo3/typo3v4core) and it won't take long until git.typo3.org is been used for version 4 as well.
	
Due to the fact that my TemplaVoila development [workflow is also already git based](http://blog.tolleiv.de/2010/06/git-svn-for-typo3-extension-development/), I thought it might be interesting for some contributors to develop with a git repository upstream. Therefore I started to maintain a [TemplaVoila repository on github.com](http://github.com/tolleiv/TemplaVoila) [1]. The [Subversion repository on forge.typo3.org](https://svn.typo3.org/TYPO3v4/Extensions/templavoila/) [2] is of course still the master, but both repositories are kept in sync automatically.
	
So once you think about sending an RFC to the typo3.team.templavoila list, feel free to attach a git based patch-file.
