Markus Beckedahl's interview with Peter Sunde brought up some interesting insights into the system of [flattr.com](https://flattr.com/) and the idea behind it. So if you're interested in [flattr.com](https://flattr.com/) you should  listen the [podcast on netzpolitik.org](http://www.netzpolitik.org/2010/npp095-peter-sunde-uber-flattr/).

My favorite quote:_"In the end stupid stuff founds good stuff"_ P. Sunde
