Today I got the hint from a colleague that there's some app from RockstarApps which enables to optimize CSS and JS in Eclipse on the fly. I just did some work on my[ imagemap_wizard](http://forge.typo3.org/projects/show/extension-imagemap_wizard) [TYPO3](http://www.typo3.org) extension and it seems to work pretty well - therefore I highly recommed to checkout the [Rockstar WebOptimizer](http://www.rockstarapps.com/joomla-1.5.8/products/jslex-web-optimizer/css-a-javascript-optimization.html) if you're developing Javascript applications.

It seems that it also supports CSS sprite generation - this might be a followup tomorrow ;)
