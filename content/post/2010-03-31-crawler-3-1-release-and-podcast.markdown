Nearly a month after version 3.0.5, we published 3.1.0 of the well known crawler extension today. The main work for that step was related to several bugfixes, a better scheduler integration, some CLI-API enhancements, better testcases and (finally) some documentation updates. Most kudos go to Michael Klapper who took over the responsibility for this release and who also fixed a decent amount of bugs.
You can download the extension in the [TER ](http://typo3.org/extensions/repository/view/crawler/current/) and hopefully this time OpenOffice didn't trick us again and you'll be able to see a shiny new extension manual on typo3.org as well.

Besides that, Kasper just released the podcast with me talking about version 3.0 of the crawler and about further improvements for the staticpub extension. You'll find that on [typo3.org/podcasts/kasper](http://typo3.org/podcasts/kasper).
