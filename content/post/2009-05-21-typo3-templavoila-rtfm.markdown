[Dmitry](http://www.dmitry-dulepov.com) and [Steffen](http://www.sk-typo3.de/) included some of the AOE guys (including me) into the TemplaVoila team and we all try to contribute into the project from now on. Therefore I just checked the Unit-tests for TemplaVoila and tried to find a way how to improve them in the future and somewhere within the tx_templavoila_api -Class I found the PageTS key "**tx_templavoila.storagePid**". That seems to be some kind of nice workaround for everyone who's not interested to mess up the TYPO3 general record storage page with the TemplaVoila DS/TO storage-folder. I wonder how many other hidden gems will find the way into day-light in the future :P
