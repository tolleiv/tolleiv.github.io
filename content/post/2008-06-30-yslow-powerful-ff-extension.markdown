I use [firebug](http://www.getfirebug.com/) for a while and I love it especially for CSS and JS debugging. Today I stumbled over [Yslow](http://developer.yahoo.com/yslow/) and did some tests with it one some of my clients pages and I love the results.  
YSlow can help you to analyze all the referenced elements on a webpage. It shows their sizes, how they behave when a page is taken from the browser-cache, shows optimization hints and enables a easy way to optimize the output of your dynamically created webpage :) ... you'll love it.
