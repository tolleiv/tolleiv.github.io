After I switched to Octopress, I ran into a bunch of issues which kept me from publishing more often. One of the main issues was the ongoing struggle with the publishing workflow itself (you see it's not my fault but the tools). In the past days I've switched to [Hugo](http://gohugo.io) and implemented an automated [publishing workflow with travis-ci](http://rcoedo.com/post/hugo-static-site-generator/). The content migration itself wasn't too impressive, using ``hugo import jekyll ..`` did all the magic for me :)

Let's see if that boosts my motivation.
