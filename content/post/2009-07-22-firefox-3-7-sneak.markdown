I just stumbled over some Firefox 3.7 screens. It seems that the mozilla developers plan/brainstormed to change same smallers parts:





> 
	
>   1. **Embracing Glass:** Toolbar and Tabs using Glass. Buttons translucent and slightly glossy to meld with the toolbar. Raised 3D lookachieve tactile "feel".
> 
	
>   2. **Page Button:** Connect the Page button to the left side of the tab area. Directly connected to the Page.
> 
	
>   3. **Tools/Bookmark Bar:** Connecting the Tools button to the side of the Window to emphasize the fact that it is used for customizing and changing the UI. Adding a button next to that to toggle the Bookmarks Bar which is turned off by default.

Looks pretty cool - but see yourself wihin the [mozilla wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Firefox/3.7_Windows_Theme_Mockups).
